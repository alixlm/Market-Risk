# 📊 Market Risk Project Report

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains the work for the **Market Risk** course (2024-2025) in Financial Engineering at ESILV. The project explores fundamental aspects of market risk analysis, focusing on practical computation and the application of various methodologies. Topics covered include:

- 💼 **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** calculation
- 🌪 **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)** applications
- 🏦 **Liquidation strategies**
- 🔍 **Multiresolution analysis** of financial data

The project is implemented using Python, with core dependencies being:

- 🐍 **NumPy**
- 🐼 **Pandas**
- 📊 **Pyplot**
- 🧮 **SciPy.stats**

While leveraging these powerful libraries for convenience, the main objective is to build a deeper understanding of the underlying methodologies by minimizing reliance on pre-built tools whenever possible.

## 🌟 Abstract
The purpose of this project is to develop an understanding of market risk through practical computation techniques. By evaluating Value-at-Risk, applying extreme value theory, and analyzing financial data through multiresolution approaches, we gain insights into the risks involved in market fluctuations.

The accompanying code emphasizes practical learning and a deep understanding of financial engineering concepts.

## 🔎 Introduction
Market risk refers to the potential for financial loss here the main point is :

- 💱 **Exchange rates**
- 📊 **Equity values**

This form of risk plays a significant role in financial institutions and investors' decision-making processes and portfolio management, influencing both their stability and profitability.

Understanding and managing market risk are critical for:

- 🛡 **Capital preservation**
- 💼 **Optimizing portfolios**
- 📈 **Ensuring long-term financial success**

This document delves into the technical aspects of market risk assessment and analysis. For better understanding, explore the code and accompanying commentary in the repository.

## 🔢 Project Details
### 1. 💼 Value-at-Risk (VaR) Computation
VaR is a widely used risk metric that estimates the potential loss in a portfolio's value over a defined period for a given confidence level.

### 2. 🌪 Extreme Value Theory (EVT) Application
EVT is employed to model the behavior of extreme market events, focusing on **tail risk** — rare but impactful price movements.

### 3. 🏦 Liquidation Strategies
Liquidation strategies are developed to manage the process of selling assets in adverse market conditions while minimizing losses.

### 4. 🔍 Multiresolution Analysis
This section focuses on analyzing financial data using **wavelet transforms** and **multiresolution techniques** to understand market patterns and price changes over multiple time scales.

---


## 🔚 Conclusion
This project offers an in-depth analysis of market risk and employs various mathematical and computational techniques to understand potential financial losses under different market conditions. The code, techniques, and observations presented are valuable for those involved in **portfolio management** and **financial risk analysis**.
