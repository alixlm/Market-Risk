# 📊 Market Risk Project Report

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains the work for the **Market Risk** course (2024-2025) in Financial Engineering at ESILV. The project explores fundamental aspects of market risk analysis, focusing on practical computation and the application of various methodologies. Topics covered include:

- 💼 **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** calculation
- 🌪 **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)** applications
- 🏦 **Liquidation strategies**
- 🔍 **Multiresolution analysis** of financial data

The project is implemented using Python, with core dependencies being:

- 🐍 **NumPy**
- 🐼 **Pandas**
- 📚 **Scikit-Learn**
- 🧮 **SciPy.stats**

While leveraging these powerful libraries for convenience, the main objective is to build a deeper understanding of the underlying methodologies by minimizing reliance on pre-built tools whenever possible.

## 🌟 Abstract
The purpose of this project is to develop an understanding of market risk through practical computation techniques. By evaluating Value-at-Risk, applying extreme value theory, and analyzing financial data through multiresolution approaches, we gain insights into the risks involved in market fluctuations.

The accompanying code emphasizes practical learning and a deep understanding of financial engineering concepts.

## 🔎 Introduction
Market risk refers to the potential for financial loss due to changes in market conditions, such as:

- 📈 **Interest rates**
- 💱 **Exchange rates**
- 💰 **Commodity prices**
- 📊 **Equity values**

This form of risk plays a significant role in financial institutions and investors' decision-making processes and portfolio management, influencing both their stability and profitability.

Understanding and managing market risk are critical for:

- 🛡 **Capital preservation**
- 💼 **Optimizing portfolios**
- 📈 **Ensuring long-term financial success**

This document delves into the technical aspects of market risk assessment and analysis. For better understanding, explore the code and accompanying commentary in the repository.

## 🔢 Project Details
### 1. 💼 Value-at-Risk (VaR) Computation
VaR is a widely used risk metric that estimates the potential loss in a portfolio's value over a defined period for a given confidence level.

### 2. 🌪 Extreme Value Theory (EVT) Application
EVT is employed to model the behavior of extreme market events, focusing on **tail risk** — rare but impactful price movements.

### 3. 🏦 Liquidation Strategies
Liquidation strategies are developed to manage the process of selling assets in adverse market conditions while minimizing losses.

### 4. 🔍 Multiresolution Analysis
This section focuses on analyzing financial data using **wavelet transforms** and **multiresolution techniques** to understand market patterns and price changes over multiple time scales.

---

## 🛠 Code Structure
The repository's main code structure includes:

- **📂 Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean and prepare market data for analysis.
- **📊 Risk Metrics**: Functions and methods to calculate VaR, EVT, and other related metrics.
- **📈 Visualization**: Code for plotting risk measures and financial data to help with interpretation.
- **🧩 Analysis**: Final scripts integrating all methodologies for market risk evaluation.
